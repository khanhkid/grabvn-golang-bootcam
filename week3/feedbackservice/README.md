Default Feedback

        feedBackData = []pb.PassengerFeedback{
            {BookingCode: "1", PassengerID: 2, Feedback: "This is feedback1"},
            {BookingCode: "2", PassengerID: 2, Feedback: "This is feedback2"},
            {BookingCode: "3", PassengerID: 2, Feedback: "This is feedback3"},
        }

Thank you for review my code

Question:

If possiable, Could you share about how we remove multi-items from a slice? (in `DeleteFeedBackByPassengerID`)
